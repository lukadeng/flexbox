            The culture of South Sudan encompasses the religions, languages,
            ethnic groups, foods, and other traditions of peoples of the modern
            state of South Sudan, as well as of the inhabitants of the
            historical regions of southern Sudan.

            The area comprising present-day Sudan and South Sudan was subject to
            conquest and colonization for millennia. In the early 16th Century,
            the Ottoman Empire and Funj Sultanate conquered much of the former
            Nubian Empire, and historians point to the reign of Muhammad Ali of
            Egypt as a key turning point in the Sudanese slave trade.

          <p>
            Geographical boundaries, including the White Nile River, led to a
            majority-Arab north Sudan and a largely Black African south, and
            slave raids in Sudan were largely focused on the southern region of
            the territory. The British attempted to abolish slavery in the
            region as they began to take power throughout the 19th Century.
            These were largely ineffective (and helped undermine development in
            the south).

          <p>
            At the turn of the 20th Century, the United Kingdom and Egypt struck
            a joint-governance agreement that left Sudan effectively a British
            colony. This made abolition efforts more successful. However,
            British officials and missionaries focused their resources on the
            north, to the exclusion of the historically-marginalized south,
            which left the territory chronically underdeveloped in terms of
            education, healthcare, and even basic infrastructure.
